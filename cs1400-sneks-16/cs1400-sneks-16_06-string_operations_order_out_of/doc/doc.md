# 16.6) Order Out Of

The code in the given program stores the string value `"order out of"` into the
variable `a_phrase`. Using string slicing and subscripting as well as the
addition operator, write an expression to print the phrase `"out of order"`.

Hint: you will need to write multiple slicing and subscripting expressions and
concatenate all of them together to get the correct result.
