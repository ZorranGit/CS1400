<p>Write a program that takes in input from the user and prints whether or not it
contains the string &#34;dog&#34;. Recall that you can use the <code>input()</code> function
(already included in the given program) to get input from the user. When
completed, your program will accept such strings as &#34;dog&#34;, &#34;bulldog&#34;, and
&#34;dogfish&#34; - all of which are good dogs. Your entire program should be written
with just a single line of code (remember how to nest expressions?).</p>

<p>Note: You will need to determine if one string contains another string - there
is a special operator for this!</p>
