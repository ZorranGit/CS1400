# 16.7) User and Dogs

Write a program that takes in input from the user and prints whether or not it
contains the string "dog". Recall that you can use the `input()` function
(already included in the given program) to get input from the user. When
completed, your program will accept such strings as "dog", "bulldog", and
"dogfish" - all of which are good dogs. Your entire program should be written
with just a single line of code (remember how to nest expressions?).

Note: You will need to determine if one string contains another string - there
is a special operator for this!
