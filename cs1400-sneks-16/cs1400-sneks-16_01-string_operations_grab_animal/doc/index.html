<p>Use subscripting to modify the given program so that it will extract and print
the word &#34;dog&#34; from &#34;cat dog mouse&#34;.</p>

<p><strong>For this exercise, we expect you to use the subscript notation on the variable
and not the string literal.</strong> If you think about it, that is more realistic than
slicing the string literal. If you ever needed to slice a string literal you
could just type out the desired substring as a standalone string literal in the
first place!</p>
