# 16.1) Grab the Animal

Use subscripting to modify the given program so that it will extract and print
the word "dog" from "cat dog mouse".

**For this exercise, we expect you to use the subscript notation on the variable
and not the string literal.** If you think about it, that is more realistic than
slicing the string literal. If you ever needed to slice a string literal you
could just type out the desired substring as a standalone string literal in the
first place!
