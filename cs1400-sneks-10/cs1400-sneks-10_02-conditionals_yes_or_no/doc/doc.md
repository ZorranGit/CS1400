# 10.2) Yes or No?

Conditional logic expressions evaluate to either `True` or `False`. These are
Boolean values, and they can be used within conditional expressions. Conditional
expressions can be expanded further using the `and` and `or` boolean operators.

Use conditional logic to print the result of the expression `True or False`.
