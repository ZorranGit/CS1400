<p>Write a function called <code>midpoint</code> that consumes a list and returns the middle
value in that list. For example, when given the list <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> it would return
the value 2.</p>

<p>You are only allowed to use a single if statement. Hint: how can you generally
define the index of the mid-point of the list?</p>

<p>Assume that the sub-type of the given list could be any data type, but the type
should be irrelevant to your solution.</p>

<p>You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.</p>

<p>Here are a few more examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>When given [True, False, True], it should return False.</li>
<li>When given [1, 2, 3, 4], it should return 3.</li>
<li>When given [&#34;apple&#34;], it should return &#34;apple&#34;.</li>
<li>When given [], it should return [].</li>
</ul>
