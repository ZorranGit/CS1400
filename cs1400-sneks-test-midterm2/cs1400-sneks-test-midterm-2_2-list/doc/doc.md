# Midterm 2) Question 2

Write a function called `midpoint` that consumes a list and returns the middle
value in that list. For example, when given the list `[1, 2, 3]` it would return
the value 2.

You are only allowed to use a single if statement. Hint: how can you generally
define the index of the mid-point of the list?

Assume that the sub-type of the given list could be any data type, but the type
should be irrelevant to your solution.

You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.

Here are a few more examples:

- When given [True, False, True], it should return False.
- When given [1, 2, 3, 4], it should return 3.
- When given ["apple"], it should return "apple".
- When given [], it should return [].
