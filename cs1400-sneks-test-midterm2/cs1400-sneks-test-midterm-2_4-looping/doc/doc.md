# Midterm 2) Question 4

Write a function called `maximum` that consumes a list of numbers and returns
the maximum number in the list. If the list is empty it should return None.

For example, if the given list were `[1,4,5,7,4,2,1]` it would return 7. If the
given list were `[]` it would return None.
