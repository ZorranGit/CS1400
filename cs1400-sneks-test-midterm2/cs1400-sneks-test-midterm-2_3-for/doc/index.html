<p>Write a function called <code>count_me</code> that consumes a list and a singular value.
The function should count how many times the value occurs in the list and return
that amount, even if the list is empty. The sub-type of the list may be
anything, but you can assume that it will be the same type as the value
parameter.</p>

<p>For example, when given the list <code>[&#34;burrito&#34;, &#34;taco&#34;, &#34;burrito&#34;, &#34;nachos&#34;]</code> and
the value &#34;burrito&#34;, your function should return 2.</p>

<p>You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.</p>
