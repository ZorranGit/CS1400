# Midterm 2) Question 3

Write a function called `count_me` that consumes a list and a singular value.
The function should count how many times the value occurs in the list and return
that amount, even if the list is empty. The sub-type of the list may be
anything, but you can assume that it will be the same type as the value
parameter.

For example, when given the list `["burrito", "taco", "burrito", "nachos"]` and
the value "burrito", your function should return 2.

You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.
