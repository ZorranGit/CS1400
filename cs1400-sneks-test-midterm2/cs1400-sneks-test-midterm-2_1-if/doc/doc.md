# Midterm 2) Question 1

Write a function called `student_status` that consumes a number representing how
many credits a student has recorded on their transcript. Since registration is
opened to students according to enrollment class level or status, your function
should help to determine a student's registration status based on their
accumulated number of credits. It should return the student's corresponding
class level using the following criteria:

- "Freshman" for credits less than 30.
- "Sophomore" for credits 30-59 (inclusive).
- "Junior" for credits 60-89 (inclusive).
- "Senior" for credits 90 and above.

You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.
