<p>Write a function called <code>student_status</code> that consumes a number representing how
many credits a student has recorded on their transcript. Since registration is
opened to students according to enrollment class level or status, your function
should help to determine a student&#39;s registration status based on their
accumulated number of credits. It should return the student&#39;s corresponding
class level using the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;Freshman&#34; for credits less than 30.</li>
<li>&#34;Sophomore&#34; for credits 30-59 (inclusive).</li>
<li>&#34;Junior&#34; for credits 60-89 (inclusive).</li>
<li>&#34;Senior&#34; for credits 90 and above.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are encouraged but not required to unit test this function.</p>
