# 21.4) Grading on a Curve

The formula below calculates a curved grade by applying a square
root:

`curved_grade = original_grade^.5 * 10`

Define a function named `curve_grade` that consumes a grade and uses the formula
to return the curved grade. Write at least three unit tests for the function to
confirm that it works.
