<p>Type your full name and D# as strings into the proper assignment statements
found in <code>login.py</code>. The format for your D# should be: &#34;D00######&#34;.</p>

<p>There is no need to run or test this step. Simply submit this problem and, if
you typed in your name and D# correctly, you will be moved on to step 2. You
should then open the file <code>question3.py</code> and proceed from there.</p>
