# Midterm 1) Question 3 - Logging in

Type your full name and D# as strings into the proper assignment statements
found in `login.py`. The format for your D# should be: "D00######".

There is no need to run or test this step. Simply submit this problem and, if
you typed in your name and D# correctly, you will be moved on to step 2. You
should then open the file `question3.py` and proceed from there.
