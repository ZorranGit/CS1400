# 17.3) Double Function Calls

The function `float` consumes a string and converts it to a float.
Use the `round` function and the `float` function together
along with the `print` function to print the string
`"9.50"` as a whole number after storing the result in a
variable.

Here is an example of using the `float` function:

```python
price = float("10.0")
```
